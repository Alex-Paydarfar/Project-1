# Project 1 - Aloha Apparel Co.
This is my first project where I practiced how to create HTML markups, styling them with CSS and adding jQuery functionalities. It is a simple website for Aloha Apparel Co. where they showcase their products and how customers may shop online.

## Learning Experience.

It is my first time learning and applying all the skills that I acquired regarding websites. Before taking my course, I had no clue on how any website works, but now I am confident in my skills that I am able to create and style a descent website. I still need to refine my skills, specially with cleaning up my codes and mastering Javascript.
